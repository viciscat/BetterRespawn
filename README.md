# Better Respawn

This a mod created for the Paranagi modpack, which is quite hard! [Discord and download](https://discord.gg/UNaZNpdcMj)

This makes it a bit easier to respawn and get out of a pickle when you are getting spawn killed by like 10 parasites or something. If you die more than 4 times in the span of 
5 minutes you will receive some armor, some potion effects and a temporary buffed Iron Golem!

This being a mod for a modpack it requires some other mods!
- Potion Core
- SR: Parasites
- Parasites Cotasia addon thing
- Electroblob's Wizardry
- My own mod that changes withers to be worse.
